# LZ-Archiver

Usage: 

  Archiver.exe FolderName to encrypt a folder
  
  Archiver.exe FileName.extension to decrypt a crypted file

  This has a possibility of being adapted to already an existing project that reads the data from text files either image file either binary files and much more. So instead reading the data from the unencrypted file it can read it from the encrypted file for reasons like security, avoid stealing your resources etc.
